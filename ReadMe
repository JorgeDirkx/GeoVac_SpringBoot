Vaccines are there to protect and save childrenâ€™s lives, but almost 20 percent of infants
misses out on the basic vaccines to live healthy lives.

Each year more then 1.5 million children die from diseases that can be
prevented by vaccination.

Each year millions of lives are saved by immunization.

This application enables organisations to register, monitor and investigate areas
where there are low immunization levels.
